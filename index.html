		<p><em>Giving a Belly Rub</em> is dedicated to making others smile whenever life is giving them a rough day. No matter who you are, 
		everyone can't help but feel happy at giving a good ole belly rub to one our own <b>sweet</b> animal dwellers. 
		Paetrons will tell you that spending a few moments a day here will make your day shine a <s>little</s> <ins>lot</ins> brighter.</p>

		<h2 id="Instructions">How To give a belly rub</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>First knock on the door of a companion of your choice. <b>It's rude to try to give a belly rub to a companion that 
				doesn't feel like having belly rubs.</b> <i>Some companions don't like belly rubs at all. It can be very sensitive for them :(.
			</i></li><br />
			<li>
				If a companion allows you to approach them. <b>Great!!!</b> Simply kneel down right next next to them so they can feel safe :). 
			</li><br /> 
			<li>
				Gently place your on your companion's belly, preferably where there's the most fur. Slowly stroke their belly from top to bottom and give
				them the most amount of love you possibly can. 
			</li><br /> 
			<li>
				When you're done, don't forget to give your companion a kiss and say goodbye. :). 
			</li>
		</ol>
